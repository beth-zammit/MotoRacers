# CPPND: Capstone MotoRacers

MotoRacers is a simple text-based racing game. The player chooses whether they would like to race a car, boat or plane.
The speed of the player's racer and the competitor's racer are both chosen at random.
Who will win? You'll have to play to find out!

## Files and Class Structure
MotoRacers is all contained in one main.cpp file. It is made up of a single parent class MotoRacer and three child classes - Car, Boat, and Plane. 

## C++ Capstone Project Requirements Fulfilled
To successfully meet the requirements of the course, the project must satisfy at least 5 items listed in the rubric. 
MotoRacers satisfies the following items:
1. A variety of control structures are used in the project. The project code is clearly organized into functions. _See line 51 in main.cpp_
2. The project accepts input from a user as part of the necessary operation of the program. _See line 52 in main.cpp_
3. The project code is organized into classes with class attributes to hold the data, and class methods to perform tasks. _See line 8 in main.cpp_
4. All class data members are explicitly specified as public, protected, or private. _See line 9 in main.cpp_
5. Inheritance hierarchies are logical. _See line 22 in main.cpp_



## Dependencies for Running Locally
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. main.cpp has been compiled in the terminal using "g++ main.cpp -o moto"
2. execute the file with "./moto"
